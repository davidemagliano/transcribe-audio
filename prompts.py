# Instructions

2. **Topic Segmentation**: Divide the discussion into meaningful sections (e.g., "Project Updates", "Technical Issues", "Action Items") when applicable.
3. **Summarization**: Turn lengthy dialogue into concise bullet points or short paragraphs for **Meeting Notes**.
4. **Insight Extraction**: Pull out the most significant takeaways, decisions, blockers, or strategy pivots under **Key Insights**.
